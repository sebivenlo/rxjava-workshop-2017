This workshop serves as an introduction to the concept of asynchronous and event-based programming, using principles of reactive and functional programming to bring a different approach to concurrency to the basic parallelism used in most programs today. This programming idiom will be illustrated using RxJava, which implements these principles in the form of reactive, observable streams, similar to the more recently introduced Java 8 Streams package.
